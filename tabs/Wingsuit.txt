Cm                Bb
Steal away, let's steal a car
Eb    	                      F
You'll never win a major only shooting par
Cm            Bb
Step outside, feel the sun
Eb                                      F
It's only you, be you, cause you're the only one


Chorus: (repeat 2x)
       Dm   C
[no vocals]
       Dm    C
And it feels good
         Dm    C
Cause it feels good
       Dm    C
And it feels good


Nothing lasts, nothing stays
Caught in this procession of unchanging days
What's new is old, what's old is gone
You're pushed up to the edge so put your wingsuit on

[repeat chorus 1x]

Bb            F                      Dm    C
And gliding away you fly where you choose
Bb                 F                  Gm
There's nothing to say and nothing to lose

[repeat intro]

Cm          Bb             Eb    F
Steal away, paint the sky

Put your wingsuit on (4x)

Bb             F                     Dm    C  Dm  C

There's nothing to say and nothing to lose
