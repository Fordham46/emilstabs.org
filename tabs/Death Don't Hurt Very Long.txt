Death Don’t Hurt Very Long
G#m jam

Death don't hurt very long
Death don't hurt very long
Death don't hurt very long
Death don't hurt very long

Oh yeah

Frozen in place (death don't hurt very long)
Cast into space (death don't hurt very long)
Transported too fast (death don't hurt very long)
You know it don't last 

Up on the ground (death don't hurt very long)
Shaken by sound 
Descended from apes (death don't hurt very long)
You're just changin' shapes (death don't hurt very long)

Death don't hurt very long
Death don't hurt very long
Death don't hurt very long
(stop!) Death don't hurt very long

Melody riff 4x

(Death don’t hurt very long) It’s only your perception (Mike)
Singin' this song (death don't hurt very long)
(Death don't hurt very long) It’s only perception (Mike)
Singin' this song (death don't hurt very long)

(with spooky laughs, even from Haunted House midi?)
Frozen in place

Descended from apes
You're just changin' shapes

Death don't hurt very long
Death don't hurt very long
Death don't hurt very long
(stop!_ Death don't hurt very long……ugh!
