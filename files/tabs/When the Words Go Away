When the words go away

C              G
C              G

    C              G      C
The snow is coming faster
              	    G
My view ‘round the bend
   C        G
A beautiful valley
	            D 
Tucked into a glen
               F
Can barely be seen
                 C 
But where is the wind
          Em
Where is noise
          F
Where are voices again

C     	     G       C
Locked in a capsule
                G    C
For time without end
             G
Watching the world 
        D
From a pane or a lense
        F
There’s nothing to fear
              G
When there’s nobody near
      Em
But silence can kill 
            F
And there’s lots of it here

C	            G	
We decided to part
C                G
Each make a new start 
F
But I didn’t know
C                          G
What you’d take when you’d go
C
Now I’m beholden
F
To Silence not golden
C                  F
There’s nothing to say
         C
When the words go away

C                     G


C        G           C
Embraced isolation
              G      C
It’s never a choice
               G
I long for the comfort 
                D
I get from your voice

              C
The vacuum of sound
                        G
That you leave when you go
                 Em
Is spreading the silence
                F
Around us like snow

C             G
We decided to part
C              G
Each make a new start 
F
But I didn’t know
C                            G
What you’d take when you’d go
C                  G
Now I’m beholden
    Em
To silence not golden
         F
There’s nothing to say
C                    G
When the words go away
C                    G
When the words go away
C                    G
When the words go away.
