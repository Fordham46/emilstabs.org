  D C G C G D over entire song
The birds are the enemies their songs in the sun
Are hammering nails in the coffin of fun
The last drop of warmth from your soul has been wrung
You now have to face that the day has begun

It means you'll be summoned to a place they call 'work'
In whose hallways you linger and corners you lurk
You're already three days late on a task
They gave you to fail, they don't even ask

Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water
Jack fell down and broke his crown and Jill came tumbling after
Amidst the Peels of Laughter

Your brain is in pain and your fate has been sealed
The liquid inside of your eyes has congealed
You can't see in color or discern friend from foe 
The neighbors wake slowly and glare 'cause they know

That you don't fit in, you can't earn their trust
You're up at all hours, you're not one of us
They scowl at your windows and smile at the sun
The world has awaken, the day has begun

Against my will drawn up the hill to fetch a pail of water
In pain I'm chained to the back of a train
Where I remain thereafter
Amidst the Peels of Laughter

Lose the caboose I'm calling a truce
