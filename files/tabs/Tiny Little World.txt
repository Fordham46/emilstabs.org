E  A  G  Dbm (x2)

Cmaj7   Dbm          Cmaj7   Dbm   A
Coffee shop, sipping froth I watch her
E    A              G       Dbm              E   A   G  Dbm
On a walkie-talkie, talkin' sloshy 'n naught-ay
E         A                G         Dbm            E            A  G  Dbm
Losin' my Zen contentment, drugged entranced by her lilac mist
E          A             G               Dbm            E   A  G  Dbm
Not actin' cock-ay, just came to get some nuts and a latte
E            A            G                 Dbm            E    A   G   Dbm
Drench me in pretense and tempt me with the quench of your kiss

[Chorus]
      E           A      G                Dbm
In my tiny little world, caught up in the motion
E                  A      G                 Dbm
Tryin' to find the sauce, shake it like the ocean
E              A     G               Dbm
Got to take it slow, try and find my posse
    E                A           G                 Dbm
But nothing's making sense, so I shake and make it saucy

Cmaj7     Dbm          Cmaj7      Dbm         A
It's not enough, in my eyes night falls; Oh I follow her light
E  A           G        Dbm              E         A   G  Dbm
   Slow motion strobes, swirl at Benny's Boomerang
E             A             G            Dbm                E              A  G  Dbm
Climbing in a bass-bin, I'm shakin' and fallin' through the dark and spit out
E         A                G                Dbm             E            A  G  Dbm
Dive over shoulders Harlem shake-dance on a bar-stool and I feel a yank
E           A                G               Dbm                E   A   G   Dbm
A ballerina balancing on the bar kicks and I fall and black out

[Chorus]

[Train that Could Thingy]
                             A    G      Dbm
Ride that little bitty train that could
E                      A          G      Dbm
Ride that little bitty train that could

Cmaj7      Dbm                Cmaj7           Dbm                A
Drowned in sleep, the morning comes, crawl on concrete and climb up in my car
E      A         G              Dbm              E      A   G  Dbm
  When 2 notes cross, delivered wrong ain't it a pity?
E                   A        G           Dbm                  E          A    G  Dbm
Phone's ringing and ringing, running red lights while they're hunting me down
E           A               G            Dbm               E      A  G  Dbm
Got 2 house closings at the same time in two parts of this city
E                A            G              Dbm        E   A   G   Dbm
Gotta put you on hold while I calm my secret other life down

[Chorus]

[Train that Could Thingy, with these lyrics underneath:]

I'm reaching outta body, you can be my hot toddy
Ain't tryin' to be gaudy but you hot like a hibachi
I pulsate like an earthquake, be my soul mate when we calibrate
Start to free-associate you're makin' me evaporate
My wish is to be squished, blown back out like a blowfish
Pickin' up your wishes like a satellite dish
And every chef knows it's the sauce that makes the dish

Cmaj7   Dbm          Cmaj7   Dbm   A
Coffee shop, sipping froth I watch her
