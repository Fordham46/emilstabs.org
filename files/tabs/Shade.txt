Intro
D  A  G  x2

D
I found a ring, deep inside a box
    Bm
On a dead end street, and you were there watching me
    Em
But I didn't know, I couldn't see
     G
I was lost, asleep inside a fantasy

D
I love your hair in the mornings you know
     Bm
You love to run wild, and let the mane flow
       Em
But you run away, but we meet again soon
G
South of the border and over the moon

Bm              (A)  G
When you're gone it never feels right
Bm                (A)  G
It gets so cold in the dark of the night

Chorus
D                                 G
I only like the shade when you're blocking the light  x2

D   A G

D
I put the ring back where it belongs
    Bm
It feels right, and you were wating up all night
Em
I didn't know if I went away
        G
And got lost, that you'd still be there anyway

D
I figured out what you whispered that night
Bm  
Somewhere the clouds touch the mountains just right
Em
Somewhere we're dancing and you're singing the tune
G
South of the border and over the moon

Bm              (A)  G
When you're gone it never feels right
Bm                (A)  G
It gets so cold in the dark of the night

Chorus
D                                 G
I only like the shade when you're blocking the light  x2

The band sort of sings in the style of a round here, the chords are
D  Cadd9  G  Em  G

D                                 Cadd9
I only like the shade when you're blocking the light
G                                 Em
I only like the shade when you're blocking the light
G                                 D
I only like the shade when you're blocking the light
