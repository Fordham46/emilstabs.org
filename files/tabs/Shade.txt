Shade Album Version (Transposed to Bb)


Intro
Bb – (Eb-Bb-Eb) - F (Bb-F)- Eb - Bb (x2)

Bb
I found a ring, deep inside a box
      Gm
On a dead end street, and you were there watching me
   Cm
But I didn't know, I couldn't see
       Eb
I was lost, asleep inside a fantasy

Bb
I love your hair in the mornings you know
     Gm
You love to run wild, and let the mane flow
    Cm
But you run away, but we meet again soon
Eb
South of the border and over the moon

Gm              (F)  Eb
When you're gone it never feels right
Gm              (F)  Eb
It gets so cold in the dark of the night

Chorus
Bb                                 Eb
I only like the shade when you're blocking the light(x2)

Bb – (Eb-Bb-Eb) - F (Bb-F)- Eb - Bb (x2)


          Bb
I put the ring back where it belongs
    Gm
It feels right, and you were waiting up all night

Cm
I didn't know if I went away
        
         Eb
And got lost, that you'd still be there anyway


Bb
I figured out what you whispered that night
Gm
Somewhere the clouds touch the mountains just right
Cm
Somewhere we're dancing and you're singing the tune
Eb
South of the border and over the moon

Gm              (F)  Eb
When you're gone it never feels right
Gm              (F)   Eb
It gets so cold in the dark of the night

Chorus
   Bb                             Eb
I only like the shade when you're blocking the 
light (x2)
