Note: the major chords E/A/D can all be played as E7/A7/D7 to your preference. Al Green wrote the song with all 7 chords, I think, but it sounds like Trey used the major often. I mix them up to taste. This was done by ear and is my first tab, so... take it or leave it.



INTRO RIFF- this is used through the song. During the intro, verse, and chorus.

Intro Trey playing E chord/Intro Riff

INTRO RIFF
Last night and the night before
Twenty-five robbers at my door
I got up and let 'em in
But I missed 'em all with a rollin' pin

E              A7            E       A7          
Alright they took everything I own
E              A7            E       A7
Like a king down from his throne
E              A7            E       A7    
I can't let it get me down
F#m7    D     E               F#m7         D
                 Change my smile into a frown
E
Oh hey yeah -eh

INTRO RIFF
(I can't let it get me down,
change my smile into a frown)

Just all about to send it southside 
Even though I know you are tired
Now it's time for love again 
Pain is found and finally went

Took everything I own 
Like a king without his throne 
I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown 

(I can't let it get me down,
change my smile into a frown)

All is fair in love and war
What are you fightin' here for
Time about to right just one
There's no cost and there's no fun

Yeah hey hey hey
It'll never happen again
But it has to end
I can't let it get me down
Change my smile into a frown 

(I can't let it get me down,
change my smile into a frown)
