Am              D   C                          Am
I get affected,       you make a sound and you mute me
Am              D   C                             Am
I get rejected,       when you move about and you lose me
F#  E  D           B
Tongue tied, I can hardly get myself to
Am             D    C
Say something
                F                               Am
Gotta say it in morse code, gotta say it on the radio
Am             D    C
Say something
            F        F#m  Gm  G#m  Am
I gotta get loose

Am                  D    C
I’m finding nothing,       when I cruise the other side
     Am                 D    C                      Am
Then I find you jumping,       out on the alley cat sidewalk so high
F#      E       D                B
My, you fall so gracefully, just gaze my way and
Am             D    C
Say something
                F                               Am
Gotta say it in morse code, gotta say it on the radio
Am             D    C
Say something
                       F         F#m  Gm  G#m  Am
and we can finally get loose sometime
           Am
Take it on high, and you can testify

D
Just when you get a little impulse to almost
                                      F      E   Eb
start vibration on the inside of your throat
E
Someone has to make an interruption
                                           G     F#    F
They tap into a hydrant, spray us with the hose
      F#
Let’s talk about the time through dirty little streets we can roam
B                                                 E
Park in every cul-de-sac and hide so we never get home
F#
Talk is cheap anyway, words can get overblown
B                                                          E
Let the transmission do it’s thing and we can swing in the drone

Am                    D  C
Say something, Say it in smoke signals
          D                                Am
Say it in Morse code, Slur it so the words erode
Am                     D     C
Say something, Move it in charades
                            D                 Am
But baby there’s no need to stay clammed up today

        Am                      D    C
In your fifteen minutes of fame, with all the network cameras aimed
          D
Could you just one time come up with a line that expresses everything that you wanted to
Am              D     C      Am
Say something
Am              Eb    D
Say something
