Everythingâ€™s Right

Intro:  B  D  A  G  F#

     B                  
It's time to get out, I paid my dues
D           
I need to shout, there's no time to lose
A
No more to give, the well is dry 
    G
The pavement's worn, my brain is fried
     F#
It's time to get out, I paid my dues

   B
My shoes have holes, my socks are bare 
    D
The mirror's secret is I'm losing my hair
A
I'm in prison without a crime 
    G
The sentence stretches on undefined
     E
It's time to get out, I paid my dues, I paid my dues

CHORUS: B A E (the rest of the way)
B                                
But everything's right so just hold tight
A
Everything's right so just hold tight
E
Everything's right so just hold tight, everything's right so just hold tight 
                               
Everything's right so just hold tight
Everything's right so just hold tight				<~2nd chorus
Everything's right so just hold tight, just hold tight

B A E 
I'm going downhill with increasing speed 
And compassion gives way if you listen to greed
Focus on the past and that's what will last 
Nothing you can feel and nothing that is real

Focus on tomorrow and you'll have to borrow 
Images in mind and thoughts you left behind
Focus on today and you'll find a way
Happiness is how rooted in the now

REPEAT 2nd CHORUS 1x

Look into the eyes of everyone you meet 
Try not to step on your best friend's feet
The line is in the sand, the flag is planted 
The rest of your life, don't take it for granted

REPEAT 2nd CHORUS 1x

4x
This world, this world, this crazy world I know
It turns, it turns, and the long night's over 
And the sun's coming up

JAM (guitar + ORGAN and KEYS)

This world, this world, this crazy world I know
It turns, it turns, and the long night's over and the sun's coming up
This world, this world, this crazy world I know
It turns, it turns, and the long night's over and the sun's coming up
