  F#    B                F#
A sad refrain as tears depart
B                     F#
  A word remains that I can start
          B              F#
To map the borders of my heart
E                        F#
 And change the channels that I chart

            B                 F#
I’m not complete but feel the heat
B                      F#
  As pavement seals me to the street
       B           F#
Immobilized I realized
E                  F#
 Misjudged the situation’s size

       E       B          Bm        F#
Though seasons change and seeds may start
    Cdim   B    Bm     F#
The beauty of a broken heart
   E      B        Bm      F#
Cannot be seen but in full view
    Cdim   B        Bm      F# 
The colors can come back to you

  F#     B                 F#
A love supreme, an ancient art
B                 F#
  A finely tuned piano part
               B                  F#
That plays its notes from stop to start
    E             F#
And hinges on a broken heart

       E       B          Bm        F#
Though seasons change and seeds may start
    Cdim   B    Bm     F#
The beauty of a broken heart
   E      B        Bm      F#
Cannot be seen but in full view
    Cdim   B        Bm      F# 
The colors can come back to you

B
Effortlessly gliding down the spiral headed toward the ground
                              F#
Of radiance arriving much too soon
B
Humbly acknowledging the thoughts inside increase my slide
    E                              F#
The grade is what propels me to my room

       E       B          Bm        F#
Though seasons change and seeds may start
    Cdim   B    Bm     F#
The beauty of a broken heart
   E      B        Bm      F#
Cannot be seen but in full view
    Cdim   B        Bm      F# 
The colors can come back to you
