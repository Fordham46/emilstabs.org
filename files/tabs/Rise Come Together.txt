E (Main Riff)
The ocean is only a lot of drops of water
The land is only a lot of grains of sand
E                      B               C#                     
People of the world all love the same way
              B           A             G 
Weâ€™re gonna break down the walls one day 
            D                   A
and come together, come together

E (Main Riff)
From high above, we're all the same down here
Without a map the lines all disappear
E                                 B
We're so tired of our senseless fight
C#                            B              A 
the one thing we can all do right is come together, 
G                    D               A
come together, come together, come together

E
We're all looking for a little more love
B
To shine a light, lift us up
F#m 
When you hold me heartbeat to heartbeat, 
A                                   B
I'm a part of you and you're a part of me
E      (Walk UP)                             D
And we rise up, rise up and come together, come together (Repeat)
