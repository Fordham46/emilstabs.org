You're smiling at me,      from your picture frame,

and I miss you
F#             F#  E      B
So many moments,     that we should have shared,
  G#m      G#m  F#   E          C#
I miss you

        B              F#          G#m             F#
And the days turn to years, and it hasn't stopped yet
    E                C#m                B       B   A   E
The memories we shared, I will never forget
                   B       B   A   E      
No I will never forget

          F#               F#  E         B
There's a hole in my heart,      that'll never be filled
  F#       F#   E   B
I miss you
     F#                  F#  E     B
This all should get easier,    but it never will
  F#       F#   E   B
I miss you
  F#                   F#  E         B
I float through the days,    and the long lonely nights
  G#m      G#m  F#   E          C#
I miss you

    B                  F#         G#m              F#
And I hear your footsteps, you're coming down the stairs
E                C#m                       E
Lost in your laughter, the sun in your hair
  B                 F#    G#m             F#
A brief recollection, the light in your eyes,
  E               C#m               B      B   A   E
I see the reflection, but it passes by
             B       B   A   E
It passes me by
