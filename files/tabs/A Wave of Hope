A Wave of Hope

Intro and Verse: Cm7 F
Chorus: Cm7 F Eb Bb > C 
Bridge: G    Bb > Ab 


From out of the chaos
A wave appears
In the moonlit confusion
Irons melted
Coming Grace, no longer frozen
The pillow drowns the moans
And shallow breaths
As dancing silvery rays change, each wave eyes a star
And the swollen moon hangs over the water
Reflections guide the way
Gold maze mirrors
As the night wheels turn
Shipwrecks sway, steel mast crashes
Spin green sky
I have grown my wings, I am flying
Ascending now, I am soaring
Untied my wrists, and flew away
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
I have grown wings, I am flying
Ascending fool, I am soaring
Untied my wrists, and Flew Away
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
We are flying, we are flying
Over the water
We are diving, we are diving
Into the water
I have grown wings, I am flying
Ascending now, I am soaring
Untied my wrists, and flew away
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
I have grown wings, I am flying
Ascending now, I am soaring
Untied my wrists, and flew away
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
I have grown wings, I am flying
Ascending now, I am soaring
Untied my wrists, and flew away
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
I have grown wings, I am flying
Ascending now, I am soaring
Untied my wrists, and flew away
This too shall pass, this too shall pass
