Tide Turns

Verse 1                     ( " " =  Play the same  chords again)

F F C
" " When you're lost in the darkness
    And the loneliness cuts so deep
    
" " When every breath is suffering
    And you're longing for sleep
    
F F G   
    You don't have to be alone
 (Do a G > F > E > Dm  walkdown )
    I've still got a kind word to spare
    G                      C
    I still have an ear to listen
             Am >  A Maj shift
    I've got time

Chorus
C                           G    F
I'll wait with you 'til the tide turns

" "
I'll wait with you 'til the tide turns
F    D
Tide turns

Verse 2

Exactly the same as 1st verse and chorus
When the wolf is at your door
And the mirror holds your nightmare
There's no need to hide your tears
If it's too much for you to bear
You don't have to be alone
I will always be there for you
Together we can make it through
We've got time
Yes we do

Chorus
I'll wait with you 'til the tide turns
I'll wait with you 'til the tide turns
I'll wait with you 'til the tide turns
Tide turns

Solo over the F > C (X4)

F F G
    You don't have to be alone
  ( G, F, E, Dm walkdown )
    I will always be here for you
    G                       C
    Together we can make it through
              Am > 
    We've got time
          A
    Yes we do
   
   Chorus
    I'll wait with you 'til the tide turns
    I'll wait with you 'til the tide turns
    I'll wait with you 'til the tide turns
    Tide turns
    
    Then Key change from C to D
    
    D                           A    G
    I'll wait with you 'til the tide turns
    I'll wait with you 'til the tide turns
    I'll wait with you 'til the tide turns
    G    E          E >  C
    Tide turns      Oooooooooo
