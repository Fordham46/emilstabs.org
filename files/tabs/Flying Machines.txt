capo 1st

C        G      Em        D       C
Flying machines paint the morning sky
          G               Em   D          C
there's a white crescent moon, hanging up high
C             G             Em    D    C
surrounded by blue, and the waves roll in
                    G
and collapse on the sand
Am             F        Bb            F                   G
Sun shows it's face, it shines on the land. Shines on the land, shines on the land

C        G           Em    D        C
Flying machines with broad majestic wings
G            Em   D          C
lines in the sky, I hear them sing
C             G           Em     D    C
perfectly designed, these scenes flash by
                              G
and they're yours and they're mine

G           Em    F               C
Yesterday's over, time takes it's toll, 
G               Em              F            C
sweet birds are flying like the wings of my soul
    G        Am     Bm          C
The warm breeze, my eyes to the sky
         F                   C        G
Feel the ebb and flow of the changing tides
         F                   C        G
Feel the ebb and flow of the changing tides

C        G         Em D        C
Flying machines as we make our way
G             Em               D          C
White moon is speechless, with nothing to say
C           G           Em   D   C
Ease into a glide, such graceful things
      F                C        G
Can't wait to see what tomorrow brings
      F                C        G
Can't wait to see what tomorrow brings
F     C       G
Fly---y-ing machines [x4]
