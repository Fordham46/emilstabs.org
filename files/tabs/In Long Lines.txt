[Verse]
D             E   
Feel the sun     in long lines
D                    E   
Ships on the horizon    in white lines
D                     E   
Listen to the voices     float in circles
D                   E   
And we're moving in long lines

B   F#m   A   B

[Bridge]
     E              B
Your eyes were wide open
             F#m     A    B    E
and black as night
E           B
I lit your cigarette, 
                       F#m     A    B   E
your hand was touching mine
E        B
The wild gypsy
               F#m    A    B
with trembling hands
         A
Now it's time to join the others, the lost, the loved ones
                                           B
They're moving around us, and waiting, and waiting

[Chorus]
   E    B         F#m         A    B
In long lines, in long lines            
   E    B         F#m         A    B
In long lines, in long lines            

 D             E

 D             E   
Feel the sun     in long lines
D                     E   
Listen to the voices    

[Guitar solo, chorus chords for two measures]

   E    B         F#m         A    B
In long lines, in long lines            
   E    B         F#m         A    B
In long lines, in long lines         

[Repeat til end, then finish on D/D6 thing]
