Main verse/chorus riff
A D G D

Breath and Burning
We are made of sand
Slowly turning
At the waves command

And what does it matter
That the nightmares all came true?
The black clouds that scattered across
The sky and there's nothing left we can do.

But celebrate while the hurricane
Throws salt and water into the room.
The canary died
The healer lied
The yellow fields disappeared too soon.

Mid-air voltage blooms and grows
Unstoppable, its instant heat.
And as sinners plea on bended knee
We'll be dancing here for days.

Breath and Burning
We are made of sand
Slowly turning
At the waves command

And what does it matter
That the end's in sight?
We're not going gently
We're gonna rage with Page at the dying of the light!

The sudden unexpected fate
Of sunken ships
Was our future path
Your string of beads did nothing to
Prepare for you what was sure to pass
Shadow wheels in shipping lanes
The angry winds blew straight from hell
And the tortoise pulls his head inside his shell.

A D G D

Breath and Burning
We are made of sand
Slowly turning
At the waves command

And what does it matter?
It'll be over soon
Our heads on a platter
So lets spin in the light of the moon
We've still got the light of the moon
We'll dance in the light of the moon.
