Leaves

G                              Bm
Someone's always telling me to breathe
    G                                     Bm       
The wind is always whispering through the leaves
   C
It sings to the world
     Am
They cling to the world
  D      C     G  
I listen and believe


    G                             Bm
The music stops and echoes linger on 

The secret to the kingdom was conferred
    G                                 Bm
I'm waiting 'til you sing me one more song

The messenger conveyed the ruler's word
    C
You promised the moon
    Am
But I need a tune
    D         C      G
For notes are rarely wrong


Bm                        D
We built a kingdom out of lies
                               F
And then we blindly fanned the fires
                                 C
We warmed our hands with glowing coals
                                Bm
But now they rain down from the skies
                      D
Rising volume muffles moans
                          F
Thoughts conveyed in undertones
                          C      D
We built a kingdom out of lies


    G                              Bm
The moonlight dances softly on the leaves
  G                              Bm
A message in the pattern that it weaves
   C
It urges me now
Am
It's pleading somehow
D       C     G
Telling me to breathe
