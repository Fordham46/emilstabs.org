  E                                             A
A flash of light, another moment stolen from my soul
  B                                              E
A thunderclap,     again I must surrender all control
                                                  A
Sudden noises startle me and strange things in my mind
B                                                  E        A 
Haunt me and I'm running scared,    running out of time

B                                                     E
There are days when sunlight seems to lift me from my bed
                                                      A
And other times I face the light with eyelids full of lead
B                                         
Light and dark pass quickly by, with no dividing line
                                A    B              E
I follow but I'm running scared,     running out of time
     A      B                 E
               running out of time
     A      B                 E
               running out of time
     A      B                 E        A
               running out of time

I follow but I'm running scared,     running out of time
     A      B                 E
               running out of time
     A      B                 E
               running out of time

               running out of time
