[intro]
E    C    D    A

E                         C
Watching the words as I'm hearing your voice
    D                    A
you seem to imply I have some other choice
        E                     C
than to follow your logic, or stay in the game,
          D                        A
though we both know the outcome is always the same.
    E                    C
The torrent of syllables all swirl around
     D                  A
as I try to decode a particular sound
          E                      C
that will serve as a lamppost, a signal or a flame
     D                       A
to dispell the impression of more of the same
[repeat the following phrase twice, then strum A to lead into the chorus]
E                    C
Higher and higher we leave the ground,
                D                     A
and we pull the lever together and we lay back down

[chorus]
E      D         A                C        D       
Tie me down, and strap me in, and crush my heart, 
    E            D                 A               C      D                     
and take a spin around the block, around the earth
  C#m              B                 A               B
A little time, with little worth, is all that I have asked you for
   E             F#   E   F# [wicked tempo increase]
so take a spin!
E             F#   E   F#
take a spin

[jam in an upbeat way over E and F# as long as you want]
[Here's the horn line that TAB plays in this part transcribed for guitar]
