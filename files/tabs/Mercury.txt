The days that are met with onlyness
Aid and abet this loneliness  *4

Tonight's the night the wheels are turning
The signal flows I try to keep the home fires burning
That was my stop but the subway kept going
Nothing to lose When Mercury's Showing

(The days that are met with onlyness, Aid and abet this loneliness)*2

The moments are mine If I can just seize the day
But then I forget what it is I meant to say
I try to hold on but never too tight
And the hours go by till Mercury comes out at night

Staring up at the great machine that never began and will never end
The silver starlit tapestry I feel countless eyes staring back at me
Venus in steel the unbreakable net Venus in steel the unbreakable net
The trails of lilies and violets ends Trapped in Steel the Unbreakable Net

With wings on your feet your day is longer than your ye-ar

I look up at the night sky And for a moment, I can see
That the rivers run deep And your day is longer than your year

The lies they feed to me are as edible as mercury
But the rivers run deep Your day is longer than your year

And the Water-star is singing its silver melody
And the rivers run deep your day is longer than your year
your day is longer than your year

But the net's unbreakable so don't worry about falling*2
The voice that you ignore might be your future calling
Alone we're tossed about like a bottle in the sea
And together we ascend and only then escape this gravity
But the net's unbreakable so don't worry about falling*4
