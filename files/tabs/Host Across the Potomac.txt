Dm                     Bb
Floodlights glare into desolate and empty rooms
Db
Twenty years, the red lights blazing
Dm                 Bb
Something's wrong, systems down the codes are broken
Db                              C     Dm
'Til our host across from the Potomac turned and stared
  Ab           Eb
a stream of molasses
C            F
too late and so it folds
       Ab         Eb
like a dream of a canon
   Db            Ab
is reckless that rolls
 B       Db       Bb
across a concrete floor
F#    Db      Ab         F#
lime, hunted, outward, invisible
                       Db               Ab              Gâ€¨
bleached white lift to nothing, at this end, connection dead

Dm             Bb
Iron gates and names remembered
   Db
To complement with invitations
Dm               Bb
Young girls tag along lackadaisical
Db                            C
In a crowd while up above the clouds
     Dm
Rich and billowy
   Ab                Eb
In dreams, a hundred voices
C           F
Sounding out as one
Ab                   Eb           Db          Ab
Daughters of joy all flowing past 50 years of bars
    B        Db     Bb
The blue and golden lines
F#      Db       Ab    F#
Hungry, complex, crazy crew
                       Db               Ab              G
bleached white lift to nothing, at this end, connection dead

F          G
Sky rockets alive and breathing
F                G
Mad red glare in jade staring eyes
F          G
Sky rockets alive and breathing
G            Bm       C
The time has come for desks and chairs to be elevated [x3, slow down on last time]

Dm     Bb
Voices inside screaming
Db
Solemnly insure the real thing
Dm            Bb
Blue eyes and blonde hair flowing
Db                                     C
Drunk like milk so thick and plush and sweet
           Dm
But it's a set up
Ab                  Eb
Poured and held for someone
C         F
More than others do
Ab                Eb
Six feet strained beyond the drop zone
Db             Ab
Pointing human joints
    B          Db
The wrists and elbows
    Bb    F#   Db
and who.. is.. with you
        Ab             F#
In this strange French curve
Ab       F#         Ab                F#
Swooping downwards, eyes and minds on detection
Ab      F#      Ab      F#
Another motive, just as deadly
              Db              Ab              G
White lift to nothing at this end, connection dead

G            Bm       C
The time has come for desks and chairs to be elevated
(Sky rockets, alive and breathing)
The time has come for desks and chairs to be elevated   
(Sky rockets, alive and breathing)
The time has come for desks and chairs to be elevated    
(Sky rockets, alive and breathing)
