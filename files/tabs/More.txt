A#                   G#
Life in slow motion, feet are in the clay
    D#
I'm going nowhere, been standing here all day
A#                        G#
I had a notion, there was something more to do
     D#
As I watched the water, from the banks of the river it swelled and grew
      A#
And I tilt to the left, lean to the right
F
tilt to the left and lean to the right
G#                                      D#
Walked on coal and slept on glass, amid swords of sound and daggers of light
       A#       F
And my heart is screaming, 
      G#                                 D#
cause half of what I say is lies, and it takes so much to keep up this disguise
A#         G#         D#
                   It takes so much to keep up this disguise

        A#                                        F
I see a doorway in the haze and I'm trying to get to it
    G#                                            D#
The stars are peepholes in a wall but we can walk through it
    A#                           F
The memory is still so real, the memory's still so real
             G#                               D#
I guess it's never really over even when it's over

        A#                             G#
But I'm vibrating with love and light, pulsating with love and light
     D#
in a world gone mad, a world gone mad, there must be something more than this
    A#                             G#
I'm vibrating with love and light, pulsating with love and light
     D#
in a world gone mad, a world gone mad, there must be something more than this

    A#                            F
The trumpet call is sounding, the trees are bending low
          G#                                D#
There's a great fire in the distance, there must be something more than this
        A#                                F
And our shadows will all be dancing, with red dust on our clothes
          G#                D#
And we'll leave by tornado, elbows in the clouds and feet in the sky

          A#                             G#
And we're vibrating with love and light, pulsating with love and light
     D#
in a world gone mad, a world gone mad, there must be something more than this
      A#                             G#
We're vibrating with love and light, pulsating with love and light
     D#
in a world gone mad, a world gone mad, there must be something more than this

A#          F           G#                D#      
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh, woah ohhh ohh ohh ohhh ohhh
A#          F           G#                D#      
Ohhhh ohhhh ohhhh, woah ohhh ohh ohh ohhh ohhh

      A#                             G#
We're vibrating with love and light, pulsating with love and light
     D#
in a world gone mad, a world gone mad, there must be something more than this
      A#                             G#
We're vibrating with love and light, pulsating with love and light
     D#                                                                     A#
in a world gone mad, a world gone mad, there must be something more than this
