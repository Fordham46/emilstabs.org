Evening Song

Intro: F

F                       G
Approach the night with caution
                           Am
It’s the best that you can do
                         G
Move quickly through the darkness
                       F
’Til the daylight is renewed

F                       G
Approach the night with caution
                           Am
You will know it’s for the best
                G
Once tomorrow’s morning
                            Bb
Quells the thumping in your chest

Bb                  F          C    C            
For evening is when all things dark caaaan
Bb                F      C  C
Slide around with ease
Bb                      F
And good things all get shoved in shadows
C                   C  C
By a wicked breeze

Chorus:

F                       G
Approach the night with caution
                    Am
No longer shall you roam
             G
When darkness stains the eastern’s sky
                     Bb
Be sure that you are home

Bb                 F        C  C    
The night is the dividing line thaaaat
Bb                   F      C  C
Blends the right and wrong
Bb                   F
And spirits crossing freely over
C
Can hold you there too long

JAM OVER VERSE

REPEAT 3rd VERSE & LAST CHORUS 4x

END:
Bb                         F
It’s a good things all get shoved in shadows
C                   C  C
By a wicked breeze
Bb                   
Approach the night with caution (just Trey singing)
